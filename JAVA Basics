Here are the basics of Java programming:

1. Syntax and Structure
Case Sensitivity: Java is case-sensitive, meaning MyClass and myclass are different.
Classes: All Java code is written inside classes. The class name should match the filename.
Main Method: The entry point for any Java application.

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Code goes here
    }
}
2. Variables and Data Types
Primitive Types: Java has eight basic data types: int, byte, short, long, float, double, char, and boolean.
Variables: Variables are declared with a type before use.

int number = 10;
double price = 19.99;
char letter = 'A';
boolean isTrue = true;
3. Operators
Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
4. Control Structures
If-Else Statements: Used for decision-making.

if (condition) {
    // Code if true
} else {
    // Code if false
}
Loops: For repeating tasks.
For Loop:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // Code
}
While Loop:

while (condition) {
    // Code
}
5. Methods
Definition: Functions within a class that perform specific tasks.
Syntax:

returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // Code
    return value; // if returnType is not void
}
Example:

public int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
6. Object-Oriented Concepts
Classes and Objects: Classes are blueprints, and objects are instances of classes.
Inheritance: Allows one class to inherit fields and methods from another.
Encapsulation: Wrapping data and methods within classes.
Polymorphism: Ability of methods to do different things based on the object they are acting upon.
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
7. Basic Input and Output
Input: Using Scanner for reading input from the user.

import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
String name = scanner.nextLine();
Output: Using System.out.println for printing output.

System.out.println("Hello, World!");
8. Error Handling
Try-Catch: Handling exceptions or errors in the code.

try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
}
These fundamentals provide a foundation to start learning and building more complex Java applications.
